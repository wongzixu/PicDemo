# PicDemo (PicFinding)
This `PicDemo` or in another name `PicFinding` project is an iOS App for my first learning and first development project. It uses three main methods to fetch the desired picture from the Internet, which list as typing the word, taking the picture or just upload an exist picture to do so.
## The main UI outlook of the whole App
We roughly use the `UIKit` to develop our UI layout, and intergrate with a little `SwiftUI`, and the final project layout and design look is showing below.
